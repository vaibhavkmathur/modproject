# Management of Organizational Data

- This project is done with a B2B e commerce retail partner to design their database
- We used sql to identify key business insights and proposed a dashboard solution to the client

## Steps
- Step 1: Gathered business requirements in 3 rounds of interactions with key team members
- Step 2: Prepared ERD diagram to encorporate the business data requirements
- Step 3: Collated the data currently being gathered by the client using multiple platforms
- Step 4: Normalized data into 9 tables starting from single data dump
- Step 5: Using the new table clusters, created sql queries to cater business requirements
- Step 6: Proposed the design of a business dasboard as the future scope of the project
